# ASSESSMENT 5: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

1. What does it mean to implement a TDD workflow?

Your answer: A TDD workflow emphasizes having code pass tests incrementally before forming the full structure of the code. This ensures the code functions properly and through various potential scenarios. Tests are constructed and describe what the code should do. Then the code is written to pass the test.

Researched answer: Test Driven Development has a developer create a test that initially fails without any code present. Then the developer writes the code to make the test pass. The code can then be refactored to make it more efficient and streamlined.

2. What is a relational database? Are there other kinds of databases?

Your answer: A relational database organizes information into columns and rows. The columns represent the category of data and each row is a unique identification related to those specific data points. Databases can be formatted to organize data in other ways.

Researched answer: A relational database stores and accesses data that are related. The data is presented in tables where each row has a unique key identifier and the columns are the values related to that key. Non-relational databases don't utilize tables and they can store many different data types in different formats in one entry location. Examples include document data store, column-oriented database, key-value store, document store, and graph database.

3. Why is an ORM?

Your answer: ORM is Operational Risk Management. It's a cost-benefit analysis that assesses the potential risks and hazards of a plan or operation before deciding to execute it.

Researched answer: Object Relational Mapping translates between object-oriented programs and relational databases. The gem Active Record is an example of this. It acts as the translating intermediary between Ruby and SQL.

4. STRETCH: What is the difference between inheritance in JavaScript and inheritance in Ruby?

Researched answer: Ruby classes are objects and inherit behavior directly from the superclass they are based on. JavaScript classes are functions that use prototypal inheritance to construct objects with characteristics modeled after the base prototype.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Model validations: Model validations seek to verify that code executes as intended. Developers achieve this by predicting how the code will act according to specific input data and confirming the outcome through testing.

2. Params: Parameters set the variable number of arguments that will be passed into a function or method. Parameters outline the type of data and value for each argument.

3. API: An Application Programming Interface is software that is created to act as an intermediary and allow different programs to interact and talk to each other.
